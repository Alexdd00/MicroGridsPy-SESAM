The world is currently undergoing a drastic change of the energy matrix from conventional sources of energy to renewable and alternative ones. This trend is particularly relevant in the challenge of rural electrification in developing countries because in some cases the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of hybrid or renewable systems can be competitive with the extension of the main grid in order to supply the energy demand of isolated communities [1].  To this aim, optimization techniques fulfil a key role in differents aspects of micro-grid planning and operating procedure in order to reduce the LCOE for a determined micro-grid [2].  

The Micro-Grid library main objetive is to provide an open source alternative to the problem of sizing and dispatch of energy in micro-grids in isolated places. It's written in python(pyomo) and use excel and text files as input and output data handling and visualization. 

Main features:

* Optimal sizing of Lion-Ion bateries, diesel generators and PV panels in order to suply a demand with the lowest cost posible.
* Optimal dispatch from diferent energy sources.
* Calculation of the net present cost of the system for the project lifetime.
* Determination of the LCOE for the optimal system.
