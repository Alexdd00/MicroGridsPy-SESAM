Running MicroGridsPy requires:

1. Install and use Anaconda (or Miniconda)
2. Install and set up the environment for MicroGridsPy
3. Install a Solver among the supported ones (Gurobi - license required, GLPK - free to access)
4. Download and Launch MicroGridsPy with Graphical User Interface (GUI)

.. warning::
   
      The installation steps following refer to Windows. The environment for macOS (version 2.1) of MicroGridsPy is currently under development and not available. 
      We advise macOS or Linux users to rely on MicroGridsPy version 2.0 until the new environment is fully developed and released.


1 - Install Anaconda (or Miniconda)
======================================

Anaconda's package manager, known as conda, is a powerful tool for managing packages, dependencies, and environments in the Anaconda ecosystem. It is designed to handle various types of packages, including Python and R, and works across multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux). Here are key features and functions of conda:

* **Package Management**: conda allows users to install, update, and remove packages. It hosts a large repository of scientific packages and ensures that the installed packages are compatible with each other.
* **Environment Management**: One of the most significant features of conda is its ability to create isolated environments. These environments can have different versions of Python and packages, making it easier to manage dependencies for different projects without conflicts.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: conda works on various operating systems, providing a consistent experience across platforms.
* **Large Repository**: Anaconda comes with a vast repository of pre-built packages specifically tailored for scientific computing, data science, and machine learning applications. This saves time and effort in compiling and configuring these complex packages.
* **Open Source and Community-Driven**: conda is open-source and benefits from community contributions, which means a wide range of packages and continuous updates.
* **Ease of Use**: While it offers a command-line interface, conda is designed to be user-friendly, making package and environment management accessible to users regardless of their expertise in command-line tools.

**To install Conda:**

1. Download and install the `Anaconda distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ that includes support for Python 3, ensuring compatibility with MicroGridsPy.
   You can find also a complete list of installation files and old versions `here <https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/>`_ .

2. Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific operating system.

.. note::

   Review the system requirements before installing Anaconda Distribution. If you want a more lightweight installation, you can opt for `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_, which includes only conda and Python, allowing you to install additional packages as needed.
   For the scope of using and running MicroGridsPy **Miniconda** is sufficient and recommended if you have limited disk space or want more control over the packages installed on your system.

Getting started with conda using the Anaconda Prompt
------------------------------------------------------

Conda is a powerful package manager and environment manager that you use with command line commands at the Anaconda Prompt for Windows, or in a terminal window for macOS or Linux.

**Windows:**

From the Start menu, search for and open "**Anaconda Prompt**”. The Anaconda Prompt is a command-line interface tool that comes with Anaconda. 
It is particularly tailored for managing Python environments and packages within the Anaconda ecosystem and it enables users to execute Python scripts, install new packages via conda (Anaconda's package manager), create isolated environments to avoid dependency conflicts, and update the Anaconda distribution itself. On Windows, all commands below are typed into the Anaconda Prompt window.

**MacOS:**

Open Launchpad, then click the terminal icon. On macOS, all commands below are typed into the terminal window.

**Linux:**

Open a terminal window. On Linux, all commands below are typed into the terminal window.

Manage conda
-----------------

Verify that conda is installed and running on your system by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda --version

Conda displays the number of the version that you have installed. You do not need to navigate to the Anaconda directory.

.. note::

    If you get an error message, make sure you closed and re-opened the terminal window after installing, or do it now. Then verify that you are logged into the same user account that you used to install Anaconda or Miniconda.

Update conda to the current version. Type the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda update conda

Conda compares versions and then displays what is available to install. If a newer version of conda is available, type ``y`` to update.

We recommend that you always keep conda updated to the latest version.

Getting started with Anaconda Navigator
------------------------------------------

**Anaconda Navigator** starts by default when Anaconda (and not Miniconda) Distribution is first installed. Anaconda Navigator is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool included with the Anaconda distribution. 
It serves as an alternative to the Anaconda Prompt, offering a more user-friendly way to manage the various aspects of the Anaconda environment without needing to use command-line instructions.

**Windows:**

From the Start menu, search for “Anaconda Navigator” and click to open.

**MacOS:**

Open Launchpad, then click the Anaconda-Navigator icon.

**Linux:**
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Open Navigator by using the following command: *anaconda navigator*

Managing Navigator
---------------------

Through the Anaconda Navigator, users can easily manage their Python environments, install and update packages, and launch applications included in the Anaconda distribution, like Jupyter Notebooks, Spyder, RStudio, and others. It's particularly advantageous for those
who prefer a visual interface over command-line operations. The Navigator allows for easy access to different tools and simplifies the process of setting up and maintaining Python environments for various projects. This is especially beneficial for beginners or those who prefer a more intuitive, point-and-click experience in managing their Python development setup.
By default, all application tiles available to launch or install within Navigator are displayed on the Home page. Filter the application tiles with the applications dropdown menu.

2 - Install MicroGridsPy Environment
======================================

In conda, an *environment* is an isolated space that allows users to maintain different versions of Python and various packages without interference. Each environment can have its own specific set of packages and Python versions, independent of others. This is particularly useful in managing dependencies and avoiding conflicts when working on multiple projects with differing requirements. By using environments, developers and data scientists can ensure consistency and reproducibility of their work across various setups and collaborations.

Create the Environment from Anaconda Prompt
-------------------------------------------

When you begin using conda, you already have a default environment named `base`. To create a modelling environment that already contains everything needed to run MicrogridsPy, download the environment **YML file** named ``mgpy_win.yml`` from the following GitHub repository:

https://github.com/SESAM-Polimi/MicroGridsPy-SESAM/blob/Environments/mgpy_win.yml

Follow these steps to create the environment:

1. Place the YML file (`mgpy_win.yml`) in ``C:/Users/youruser``.

2. Open the Anaconda Prompt.

3. Type the following command in the Anaconda Prompt terminal:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda env create -f mgpy_win.yml

4. Activate the environment by:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda activate mgpy

.. note::

    `conda activate` only works on conda 4.6 and later versions.

Create the Environment from Anaconda Navigator
----------------------------------------------

1. **Launch Anaconda Navigator**: Open Anaconda Navigator on your computer.

2. **Navigate to Environments**: On the left-hand side of the Navigator window, click on the "Environments" tab.

3. **Import Environment**: Look for the "Import" button at the bottom of the environment list and click on "Import".

4. **Select the YML File**: In the import dialog, you will see a field to choose the YML file. Click on the folder icon next to the text box to browse your computer and select the `.yml` file you want to use.

5. **Name Your Environment**: Below the file selection, there's a field to name your new environment. Choose a meaningful name for the environment you're creating (e.g. `mgpy`).

6. **Create Environment**: After selecting the file and naming your environment, click the "Import" button. Anaconda Navigator will start creating the environment using the specifications in the YML file. This process may take some time, depending on the number of packages to be installed and your internet connection speed.

7. **Activation**: Once the environment is created, you can activate it by selecting it from the list in the "Environments" tab.

To use this environment, you can open tools like Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, or a terminal from within the Navigator while the environment is active.


3 - Install a Solver
=====================

**Gurobi:**
